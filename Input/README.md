# Using the ```inputs()``` function to type information

### The inputs function is great for when you need a user to input different information each time they run a script.

<br />
To use the inputs function you can set it up as

```python
name = input("What is your name")
print("Hello " + name)
```
As you can see when we use inputs the terminal will wait for to input something until the next line of code can run.
