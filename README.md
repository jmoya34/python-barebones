# Python Basics Tutorial
### The focus of this tutorial is to learn the bare minimum of python to begin coding. A lot will be left out of this guide of python for the sake of time. I will also introduce some syntax we are not like to use, but it is good to be at least exposed to what it is and does. If you would like a more depthful explanation of how python works, I reccomend using youtube guides such as from freecodecamp.

<br />

### Material includes:

* Using the print command
* Creating variables
* Learning variable types
* Getting input
* Working with numbers
* How to create and use list
* Learning useful list functions
* If, elif, else statements
* While loops
* For loops
* How to create functions
* Comments
* Tuple
* Dictionary
* Reading and writing files
* Modules
* Try and Except
* Pip
* Git
* Using the terminal


###  **Note:** The best way to learn is to follow along and type your own code. Simply reading and following along is not enough to learn.

# installation
### We are using Visual Studio code to create our python scripts and we will use python 3.9.0 to learn python. 
* [Link to download Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Link to download Python 3.9.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

1) The download for python is at the bottom of the page. 
* If you are using Windows, install x86-64 executable installer and run it. 
* If you are using mac click on macOS 64-bit installer and run it.
2) Once you open visual studio code; go into extensions, search python, install python and you're all set to start coding in python.
