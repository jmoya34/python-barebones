print(2 % 2) # since 2/2 = 1 in math. Python will return 0
print(3 % 2) # since 3/2 will leave a remainder of 1 python will return 1
print(4 % 2) # 4/2 leaves no remainder therefore python returns a 0
print(0 % 2) # 0/2 = 0 so python returns 0


print(1 % 2) 
# 1/2 in this case there is no remainder however since it is under 2 it will 
# return the same value that is being divided.
